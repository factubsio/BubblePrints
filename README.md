SEARCHING:

`glitterbuff` will search all blueprints by name and do a fuzzy match, then return the matches in the "best" order. It doesn't get it right 100% of the time, but what you're looking for should be in the top few results.

You can use up/down + enter to navigage the results list, so typically you will do "type search thing, press enter, hope it got it right".

You can also search by type/guid/namespace:

 * t: Type
 * g: Guid
 * n: Namespace

example:

`glitter t:Buff` will fuzzy match by name on `glitter`, and restrict the results to only blueprints whose type matches `Buff`

`g:abcdef` will find all results that have the exact substring `abcdef` in their guid.

(You can disable the seasonal theme, don't worry):
